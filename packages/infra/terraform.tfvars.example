# This file is deprecated in favor of environment-specific configuration files.
# Please use the files in the src/environments/ directory instead:
#
# - src/environments/dev.tfvars
# - src/environments/staging.tfvars
# - src/environments/prod.tfvars
#
# To use them, run (from src/ directory):
#   terraform plan -var-file=./environments/dev.tfvars
#   terraform apply -var-file=./environments/dev.tfvars
#
# Or copy the appropriate file to src/terraform.tfvars:
#   cp src/environments/dev.tfvars src/terraform.tfvars
